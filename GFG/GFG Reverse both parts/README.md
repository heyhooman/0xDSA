# Reverse both parts
Given a linked list and a number k. You have to reverse first 
part of linked list with k nodes and the second part with n-k nodes.
## Example 1
```sh
Input: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5
k = 2
Output: 2 -> 1 -> 5 -> 4 -> 3
Explanation: As k = 2 , so the first part 2
nodes: 1 -> 2 and the second part with 3 nodes:
3 -> 4 -> 5. Now after reversing the first part: 
2 -> 1 and the second part: 5 -> 4 -> 3.
So the output is: 2 -> 1 -> 5 -> 4 -> 3
```
## Example 2
```sh
Input: 1 -> 2 -> 4 -> 3
k = 3
Output: 4 -> 2 -> 1 -> 3
Explanation: As k = 3 , so the first part 
3 nodes: 4 -> 2 -> 1 and the second part
with 1 nodes: 3. Now after reversing the 
first part: 1 -> 2 -> 4 and the 
second part: 3. So the output is: 1 -> 2 -> 4 -> 3
```
### Constraints:
```sh
1 <= N <= 105 
1 <= k < N 
```
