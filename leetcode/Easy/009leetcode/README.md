## 9. Palindrome Number
`Easy`

Companies
Given an integer x, return true if x is a palindrome, and false otherwise.

 

Example 1:
```sh
Input: x = 121
Output: true
Explanation: 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.
```

Example 2:
```sh
Input: x = -121
Output: false
Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
```

Example 3:
```sh
Input: x = 10
Output: false
Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
```

### Constraints:

- -231 <= x <= 231 - 1
