## 94. Binary Tree Inorder Traversal
`Easy`

Given the root of a binary tree, return the inorder traversal of its nodes' values.

 

Example 1:
```sh
Input: root = [1,null,2,3]
Output: [1,3,2]
```

Example 2:
```sh
Input: root = []
Output: []
```

Example 3:
```sh
Input: root = [1]
Output: [1]
```

### Constraints:

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 100].
- -100 <= Node.val <= 100
