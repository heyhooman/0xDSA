## 101. Symmetric Tree
`Easy`

Given the root of a binary tree, check whether it is a mirror of itself (i.e., symmetric around its center).

 

Example 1:
```sh
Input: root = [1,2,2,3,4,4,3]
Output: true
```

Example 2:
```sh
Input: root = [1,2,2,null,3,null,3]
Output: false
```

### Constraints:

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 1000].
- -100 <= Node.val <= 100
