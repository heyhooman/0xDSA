## 226. Invert Binary Tree
`Easy`

Given the root of a binary tree, invert the tree, and return its root.

Example 1:
```sh
Input: root = [4,2,7,1,3,6,9]
Output: [4,7,2,9,6,3,1]
```

Example 2:
```sh
Input: root = [2,1,3]
Output: [2,3,1]
```

Example 3:
```sh
Input: root = []
Output: []
```

### Constraints:

The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 100].

-100 <= Node.val <= 100
